###Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

###Explanation of contents

Guidelines for run_analysis.R
-----------------------------

* Get data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder to "UCI_HAR_Dataset".
* Make sure the "UCI_HAR_Dataset" folder and the script file are in the same working directory.
* Run ("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio. 
* Output of these command will generate two csv files(tidy_dataset.csv, tidy_mean_dataset.csv) in the current working directory. 

Guidelines for CodeBook.md
--------------------------
The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
